# CIS365_DatabaseCreation

As a member of a 4 man team, created this database in SQL for a class. 

To recreate the database, run all the statements in the CreateTables file (running AdditionalCommands **LAST**). 

To recreate the examples in the Powerpoint (which was our final presentation), check the queries in the main folder. 

To see our schema, check the image file or look in the Powerpoint.
